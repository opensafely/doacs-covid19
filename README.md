# Safety of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic paper

This is the code and configuration for the safety of direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) prescribing during the COVID-19
pandemic paper released September 2022.

* This work has been published as a PrescQIPP Hot Topic and is available to view [here](https://www.prescqipp.info/media/6290/hot-topic-safety-of-doac-prescribing-during-covid19-26.pdf)
* Raw model outputs, including charts, crosstabs, etc, are available to view [here](https://jobs.opensafely.org/prescqipp/direct-oral-anticoagulant-doac-prescribing-during-covid-19/the_effects_of_covid-19_on_doac_prescribing/outputs/).
* If you are interested in how we defined our variables, take a look at the [study definition](analysis/study_definition.py); this is written in `python`, but non-programmers should be able to understand what is going on there
* If you are interested in how we defined our code lists, look in the [codelists folder](./codelists/).
* Developers and epidemiologists interested in the framework should review [the OpenSAFELY documentation](https://docs.opensafely.org)
